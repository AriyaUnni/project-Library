The Library Project makes it possible for users to search on Google through millions of books written in many different languages, including books that are rare, out of print, or generally unavailable outside of the library system.
From the ground up, dedicated and passionate TLP team members work closely with local governments, boards of education, local communities, teachers, students, volunteers, and donors. We strive to involve our volunteers and donors in almost every aspect of the donation, as transparency is a cornerstone of The Library Project. Our entire team is involved in every aspect of our library donations. A great deal of coordinated effort is involved with each of our library donations. All the teamâ€™s hard work is well-worth the tireless effort with just a single smile from a deserving child.
